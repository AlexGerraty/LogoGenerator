# LogoGenerator

# run node index.js in the intergrated terminal
# You will be asked 4 Questions
# - The Text for the Logo (Max 3 Characters)
# - The Colour of the text
# - A choice for the Shape for the logo (Circle, Triangle or Square)
# - The colour of the shape

# Once all the questions have been answered the code will create a logo.svh file that will be added to the repository.


# Issues:
# I had issues aligning the text to be in front of the shape for a fully customised experience.
